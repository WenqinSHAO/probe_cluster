# RIPE Atlas probe clustering
## Intro
to be added.
## Plan
- Select probes hosted in datacentres across the europe (need to prove this group of probes are less impacted by local conditions); (done, 27/01/16)
- Do some simple stats on prefix, ASN, country; (done 27/01/16)
  - there are probes having not network info, say address prefix; check what happened.
  - it turns out there are abandoned and disconnected probes as well selected.
- collect ping and traceroute to one DNS root server (which one? how to justify?);
- clean traces to arrive at tidy datasets;
- exploratory analysis on feature space;
